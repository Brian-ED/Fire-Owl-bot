**Help**: Sends a list of all commands.

**Roll**: Sends a random number between 1-6, or if you give a number with the command then it rolls a random number from 1 to it, example being `fo!roll 10` or you can do a range from one number to another, example being `fo!roll 50 100`, output: `64`

### work in progress:
**MuteMyself**: soft kick yourself (the user) from the discord. Meaning you won't see any channel messages or get any pings but you will still be in the discord. Used if you need a break from a discord to focus on homework and such.

**Calc**: calculate an expression

### list of user features
Autocompletes the command, so if you write the command "go" then the bot runs "Google".
Ignores capitilization on the command.

### admin only features
You have admin if you have the highest role on the server, aswell as if you're owner of the server.

You can add infinite amount of auto replies, meaning the bot can have a spesific response to a word or sentance someone says.
Similarly can you add infinite reacts, so the bot reacts to a message with an emote if someone says a chosen phrase.
you can add a reply and react delay, which have a cooldown of input 
And lastly, you can ToggleReactSpam which if turned on will make it so the bot emotes messages containing that emote's name.

Commands for all those:
*NewResponse, DelResponse, DelReact, SetReply, Channels, SetReactChannels, ReplyDelay, ReplyChance, ToggleReactSpam*

lastly some utility commands:
*SetBotChannels, ChannelIDs, Prefix*


**If the bot breaks, please either use the "recommend" command or send me a message on discord or submit an issue on this github repo**
