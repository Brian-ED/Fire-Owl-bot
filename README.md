### list of (some) user commands
**8ball**, similar to an actual [8ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8_Ball), the command makes owl-bot answer your question.

**Help**: Sends a list of all commands.

**rps**: Include either rock, paper, or scissors after the command and play a game. The bot replies with results of the game + a witty response

**MuteMyself**: soft kick yourself (the user) from the discord. Meaning you won't see any channel messages or get any pings but you will still be in the discord. Used if you need a break from a discord to focus on homework and such.

### list of (some) user features
Autocompletes the command, so if you write the command "go" then the bot runs "Google".
Ignores capitilization on the command.

### (some) admin only features
You have admin if you have the highest role on the server, aswell as if you're owner of the server.

You can add infinite amount of auto replies, meaning the bot can have a specific response to a word or sentance someone says.
Similarly can you add infinite reacts, so the bot reacts to a message with an emote if someone says a chosen phrase.
you can add a reply and react delay, which have a cooldown of input 
And lastly, you can ToggleReactSpam which if turned on will make it so the bot emotes messages containing that emote's name.

Commands for all those:
*NewResponse, DelResponse, DelReact, SetReply, Channels, SetReactChannels, ReplyDelay, ReplyChance, ToggleReactSpam*

lastly some utility commands:
*SetBotChannels, ChannelIDs, Prefix*

**If the bot breaks, please either use the "recommend" command or send me a message on discord or submit an issue on this github repo**
